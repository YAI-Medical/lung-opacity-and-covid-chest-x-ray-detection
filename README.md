## Description
X-ray photographs of representative lung diseases, Lung Opacity and COVID-19, will be classified as
deep learning, and patient disease will be classified with minimal Cost by detecting each disease site.
Correlation analysis of diseases according to gender age and correlation analysis and visualization
using various worldwide COVID-19 statistical indicators will be carried out.
